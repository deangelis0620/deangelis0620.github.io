<hr>
<p>Just a few years after the emergence of filmmakers in the mid-1890s, George Mellies created &quot;La Manoir du Diable&quot;, better known in English as &quot;The Haunted Castle&quot; or &quot;The House of the Devil&quot;, in 1896. It is considered to be the first horro movie. In the three-minute film, there are cauldrons, animated skeletons, transforming bats, and the incarnation of the Devil. </p>
